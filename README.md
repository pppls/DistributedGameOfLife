An implementation of a simple Game of Life PoC using an actor framework, similar to the example given in "Concurrency in .NET" by Riccardo Terrell. There, F#'s MailboxProcessor was used - this uses Microsoft Orleans.

The Game of Life implementation features 10000 nodes (100x100). By starting the silo on multiple servers (and hosting a membership table somewhere) , the computation can be distributed (ie. horizontal scaling.)
